    "# Welcome to Lab 7: Divide & Conquer and Decrease & Conquer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement several divide & conquer algorithms. However, not all experts would agree that they are divide & conquer algorithms. Sometimes, a distinction is made between divide & conquer and decrease & conquer. Here, divide & conquer must divide the problem into equally sized problems that both are solved by using the divide & conquer algorithm. Decrease & conquer covers all algorithms where the problem is solved by reducing the size of the problem into a smaller problem. Note, that decrease & conquer is not an official name for an algorithm. It can also be called divide & conquer with decrease by one. For each variation of the divide & conquer algorithms, we will implement one example which are merge sort, factorial, binary search, and greatest common divisor. Next week, we will work on some harder divide and conquer problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

    "As mentioned in the introduction, decrease & conquer algorithms do not divide the problem into two subset problems but decrease the problem size into an easier-to-solve problem. Decrease & conquer can also be separated into three subvariants decrease by one, decrease by constant, and decrease by variable size. Here, decrease by one is your basic recursion which is often used to solve problems in an easier way for example calculating the sum of a list by taking the first value and adding it to the sum of the rest of the list. Often these problems can also be solved iteratively. Decrease by a constant or variable size are often used to reduce the complexity but they are simple problems where a simple step can reduce the problem in half. For example, searching for a variable in a binary search tree is decrease & conquer with a variable size. Later, we will see that searching a variable in a balanced binary search tree is decrease & conquer with a constant factor. Below, you can see the schematic differences of the algorithms. Decrease & conquer with a variable size is not included as it is schematically similar to decrease & conquer with a constant factor.\n",

    "# 3.0 Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 2, we tackled binary search trees which are a good datastructure to do binary search in. This is especially true if we have balanced binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree is a tree where all branches have the same length $\\pm$ 1.  In the theory questions, we calculated that the complexity of a search algorithm in a complete binary search tree is $\\Theta(\\log(n))$. A complete binary search tree is a special version of a balanced binary search tree, but both have the same complexity. Think about why this is the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, one way to calculate the complexity is to look at the maximum height of a binary search tree. However, another way is to look at what each node in the tree represents. In a balanced binary search tree, the root node is the median value of all values in the tree. So, if the value is smaller than the root value you go left which effectively makes your search space half as big. So, in every step of your search algorithm, the search space is divided by two. This is basically what binary search is, however, in a list it requires a bit more effort where you need to look up the median of the list in every step. So both search in a balanced binary search tree and binary search on a list are example of decrease by a constant factor & conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one step of a binary search algorithm finds the median, given a minimum and maximum value, and checks if the value you are looking for is higher or lower, and discards values that are not in the correct range. Now, you do this step over and over until the value that you are looking for is the median or there are no values left. For example, let's say we have a list `[1,3,6,10,15]` and we are looking for the value `3`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Value = 3\n",

    "    minimum = 1\n",
    "    maximum = 15\n",
    "    medium  = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "    value is smaller than 6, so the maximum is now 6.\n",

However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",

Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise7_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***. If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
