    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will cover greedy algorithms. These are algorithms that at each point in the algorithm make the most optimal decision. Depending on the algorithm and the problem (state-space) this can lead to optimal or suboptimal solutions. This will be demonstrated during the lab. At the end of the lab, we will also practice with some hash tables.\n",

    "Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",

    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",

    "# 5.0 Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will practice making hash tables to recreate a simplified version of the native Python `set` datastructure. As you have learned in the lecture, a hashtable consists of a list of `M` \"buckets\", where a bucket is a list of items. Suppose we have `N` items in our set. Ideally, these `N` items are spread evenly across the `M` buckets, leading to an `N/M` runtime to add, find, or delete an item. For example, if we have 460 items and 20 buckets and the items are spread out evenly, then checking to see if a given item is in the set means iterating over a list of only 23 items since each list contains 23 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try building a set called `IntegerSet` that is based on this principle that works for integers. Suppose `M=10`. In this case, we'd use modulus 10 to give each integer an index between 0 and 10. In this example, 3 and 13 are in the same place in the array (therefore in the same bucket) because they have the same hash function output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to implement three methods similar to the native `set` datastructure: `add`, `__contains__`, and `remove`. Furthermore, we also need a method to calculate where a value needs to be placed in the array, which is done with the `get_bucket_number` method. "
