    "Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",

    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",

    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is one of the best known path finding algorithms and many algorithms have been based on it. A-star, for example, is such an algorithm that builds on Dijkstra. However, Dijkstra is in essence just a breadth-first search algorithm that reorders the queue based on some conditions. Also, a good thing to note is that the original paper of Dijkstra talks about finding the shortest path between source and destination, while nowadays people often mean finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes. In this exercise, we will implement the source node to all other nodes version of Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",

    "On a programming note, Python has a lot of ways to implement a priority queue using libraries and it is highly recommended to use these resources. However, in this exercise, we will use a \"plain\" list as a priority queue and it is your job to make sure it is sorted correctly (and therefore functions as a priority queue). This is done to get a better understanding for what is happening, however, it is not optimal for performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we implemented Prim's algorithm, and while it is a good algorithm there are more algorithms to find a minimal spanning tree of a graph. In this exercise, we will focus on Kruskal's Algorithm. This algorithm works a bit differently. Here we start by making a forest of nodes, where each tree in the forest consists of one node. As a general note, a forest is a collection of trees. The idea of the algorithm is that each tree is disjoint (not connected) of all other trees in the forest. The next \"starting\" step is sorting all edge of the graph by weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with each step, we will take the edge with the smallest weight and check if it connects two trees together or if it makes a single tree into a circular graph. If it is the first answer then we add the edge to the minimal spanning tree otherwise we don't. Continue until either all edge are checked or there is only a single tree left in the forest. See the lecture for a full explanation of Kruskal's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always good to think why there are multiple algorithms and why you want to use one or the other. Try to answer the following questions while you are creating the algorithm. Think about which algorithm is best suited for a dense graph (each node has a lot of edges) or a sparse graph (each node has only a few edges). Is the complexity different between the algorithms and what is this complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "***Important note, in this exercise, we do not use the union-find or disjoint-set datastructure! We do use a list of sets as a simplified version, you need to implement this in `Forest`. The algorithm is still the same only slower as the datastructure is not optimal.***"

The value is either negative signaling the root of the tree or a positive number that links the parent in the tree. For example, if we have the following array `[1, -1]` then there is one tree where the second index is the root of the tree and the first index points towards the second thus the second index is the parent of the first index.\n",

    "# 4.0 UNITTESTS\n",
    "\n",
    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"exercise12_{student}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards we strongly advise renaming the **\"exercise12_{student}_notebook.py\"** file to the correct file name that you need to hand in **\"exercise12_{student}.py\"**. Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise12_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

    "You are allowed to add your own unittests. \n",

    "## Uploading to Brightspace for Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can upload your Python file with the correct name on brightspace in the bonus assignment. Follow the instructions on this brightspace page carefully to have a successful submission. After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***. If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE, that you can now also upload the exercises from week 1! The process is exactly the same only there is no unittest.***"
