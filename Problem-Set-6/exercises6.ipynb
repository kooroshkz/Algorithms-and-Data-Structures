    "# Welcome to Lab 6: Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's exercises, we will focus on two concepts both related to making your search smarter. One is backtracking which prevents the exploration of state-spaces that are incorrect. The other one is the possibility to keep exploring after you already returned a solution. This is very helpful if you want to incorporate your search algorithm inside a larger algorithm. Note, that this is optional and focuses mainly on broadening your programming skill. Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

    "# 1.0 Permutations Using Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 4 question 2.0 (State-Space for Permutations), we did an exhaustive search on a state-space with only valid solutions. So, if we use backtracking to solve this state-space it would only change the algorithm by adding an extra if-statement that returns always true. Obviously, this is not very useful, however, in question 2.1 (Permutations with Replacement) of lab 4, we do have a state-space with incorrect solutions and now implementing backtracking could actually reduce the complexity compared to exhaustive search. \n",

    "# Class Attribute vs Object Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a short summary of the difference between class and object attributes. An object attribute is a variable inside an object that for each class instance (object) is unique. So far, you have only been working with object attributes. They are often declared inside the `__init__` and class object itself has no access to them. For example, take the class below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Test():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you made an object of the class and then you could access the attribute value of this object, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_obj = Test(10)\n",
    "print(test_obj.value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works fine and prints the value `10`. However, the class object itself (`Test`) has no attribute `value` and can also not access it from its instances. So the following code does not work.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Test.value\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will give the error `AttributeError: type object 'Test' has no attribute 'value'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the class object itself can have attributes. These are shared between all object instances and the class object. This could be helpful to store general information of a class or store metadata of a class such as how many class instances (objects) of this class are being used. Often in gaming, you see this where you have a class that creates enemy objects and one of the class attributes is the number of enemies. This makes sense because the total number of enemies should not change for each enemy object. This is also memory efficient as it is only stored once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class attribute is defined directly below the class. For example, in the next exercise, we will color a graph and the colors are stored in a class attribute like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Graph():\n",
    "    colors = ['r', 'g', 'b']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, both the class itself and its instances can access this attribute. For example, the following code would print twice the list `['r', 'g', 'b']`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Graph.colors)\n",
    "graph_obj = Graph()\n",

    "# 3.0 Coloring Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will color the nodes of a graph, where the rules are simple two nodes that are connected with an edge can not have the same color. Often these problems require you to find the minimal number of colors to do this. However, to make it less programming work and still practice backtracking we will focus on the following question: \"Can we color the graph with three colors, and if so give an example?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an adjacency list to represent the graph and a color list to represent the colors of each node. To wrap this all up needly we will use the `Graph` class which can be found below. Some functionality is already programmed. So take the time to see how this works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to finish the `color_the_graph` method. However, before you can start coloring the graph we need a way to add data to the `Graph` class. To do this you will use a setter, which is a method that makes sure, if you change an attribute of your class the rest of the attributes change accordingly. This prevents mistakes where for example the adjacency list is updated but not the color list. Setter are almost always named `set_....`."

    "Here, you will write a backtracking algorithm to solve the coloring of the graph problem. Because `_step`, `_next_step`, and `_is_not_incorrect` are helper methods and should not be used outside this class they start with a `_`. You can ignore it as long as you do not forget that they start with an underscore.\n",

    "# 4.0 Search with Generators \n",
    "\n",
    "## ***All exercises below are additional content for extra practice, they only count for a small percentage of the bonus (TestExpert). So, you can skip to section [5.0 Unittests](#5.0-UNITTESTS) if you do not want to do these exercises.***\n",
    "\n",
    "So, far we have seen several approaches to create solutions for a problem. We can create one solution or all solutions, use backtracking or exhaustive search, and use depth-first search or breath-first search. However, sometimes it is helpful if you can create one solutions and then create another one if needed. This is especially helpful if creating all solutions is not feasible. An example could be if need permutations to solve some other algorithm, but we do not know which permutation leads to a correct answer. Now, we could make all permutations but this is a bit expensive if the second permutation is the one that we need. Therefore, we can use generators in Python, which gives a the opportunity to first check if a certain permutation is correct before generating the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Yield Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `yield` keyword makes it possible to make a generator. `yield` is similar to `return` however if you call `next()` on an object that uses yield the code goes back to the `yield` statement and keeps running. So, this makes it possible to \"go out\" of a certain function and then go \"back in\". Let see how this works in an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func_a():\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def func_b():\n",
    "    generator_a = func_a()\n",
    "    print(f\"function b called next {next(generator_a)} times.\")\n",
    "    print(f\"function b called next {next(generator_a)} times.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "func_b()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function a\n",
    "function b called next 1 times.\n",
    "function a\n",
    "function b called next 2 times.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see `func_b` can ask for a result of `func_a` and then do something before asking for another result of `func_a`. If you did see the function `next` before this is one of the main mechanisms behind  a for loop. So the example above would also work with a for loop. Thus, the code below would have exactly the same output as the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func_a():\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def func_b():\n",
    "    for answer_a in func_a():\n",
    "        print(f\"function b called next {answer_a} times.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "func_b()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing you need to understand is how `return` works in combination with `yield`. The simple answer is that `return` does not work normally because it will not return any value and it will just stop the generator. This can be seen in the code below. Note, that the print before `return` is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func_a():\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    print(\"function a\")\n",
    "    return\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def func_b():\n",
    "    for answer_a in func_a():\n",
    "        print(f\"function b called next {answer_a} times.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "func_b()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 4.2 Permutation Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will make again an algorithm that uses backtracking to create all permutations. However, this time you will make a generator that gives back one answer each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To stop the generator from creating certain state-spaces, you can use `return`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A Warning, working with yield in recursive functions can be extremely difficult!***"

    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"exercise6_{student}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",

Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise6_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",
