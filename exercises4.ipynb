    "# Welcome to Week 4: State-Space \\& Graph Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's programming exercise, you will be working on several problems with different state-spaces and how to search for answers in these state-spaces. Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

    "# Classes as Functions \\& The `__call__` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will use classes a bit different than we have seen so far. Therefore, please read this explanation if you are not familiar with the idea that an object (of a class) can be used as a function. Similar to last week, you do not have to make your own callable classes because the framework is already given but it helps you understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Callable Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The term callable object refers to objects that are callable aka where you can give it some input in round brackets and they return an answer. So far all of you have used these kinds of objects namely when making functions. The name of functions is technically also a callable object. Below you can see a function called `some_function` which makes `some_function` an object which can be called as follows: `some_function(10)`. Thus `some_function` is an object and when you put round brackets `()` behind it you execute the code that you wrote in the `def`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def some_function(variable1):\n",
    "    print(variable1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you also might have seen lambda functions which also create callable objects but they are not directly stored in a variable. Therefore they are called a nameless function. However, you could give still store it in a variable which makes that variable a callable object. Below, we used a lambda function to create the same functionality as the `def` function above. Note, this is not how you should use lambda functions, but it illustrates what a callable object is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_function = lambda variable1: print(variable1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Callable Objects with Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "While functions are very useful, they can quickly explode in complexity. To solve this you can create helper functions, however, if all your helper functions and main function use the same variables it becomes very messy if you add a lot of arguments for each (helper) function. You might be tempted to solve this with global variables but this is really bad practice because if a file contains multiple algorithms and helper functions you do not know which global variable belongs to which algorithm. A more structured way of solving this is using classes, where you can add as much helper methods in the class as you want and you can use the object attributes to store variables that all (helper) methods need. This brings us to the magic method `__call__`, if you implement the `__call__` method in a class the objects of the class become callable and when you call them the `__call__` method is executed. To demonstrate this we will make a class that creates objects with the same functionality as the function above. In the example below `some_function` can now be used as a \"normal\" function where you call it as follows: `some_function(10)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SpecialFunction():\n",
    "    def __call__(self, variable1):\n",
    "        print(variable1)\n",
    "\n",
    "some_function = SpecialFunction()  # create the callable object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can add extra (helper) methods to your class to make the code more structured and readable and use object attributes to store variables across multiple methods. Often, these kind of classes do not have an `__init__` method and the attributes are initialized in `__call__` depending on the given arguments of `__call__`. In exercises [2](#2.0-State-Space-for-Permutations) and [3.3.1](#3.3.1-Breadth-First-Search-Framework) you can find frameworks for depth-first and breadth-first search that use these kind of classes."

    "\n",
    "In the theory questions, you designed an algorithm to solve the alternating disks problem (question 5). Here, you will program your solution. However, before you start think about the state-space and if you actively track it in your algorithm. By actively tracking, we mean that you can easily go back one step and make a different choice. Don't worry if your approach looks something like this: Go through the list, if you encounter a light disk to the left of a dark disk swap them, and keep going through the list until all the light disks are to the left of the dark disks. This is a perfect solution for the problem, however, for more difficult problems that have multiple solutions (and we want all of them) we might need a more structured approach.

    "# 2.0 State-Space for Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we implemented `alternating_disks` using a function that only uses actions that we know lead to the correct solution. So, the state-space only contains states and actions that lead to the solution. However, in each state, the possible correct actions are hard to predetermine as they depend on which state-space you are currently in. In a relatively simple algorithm, this is not hard to implement in a single function where we just quickly search for it. This is basically what the step \"Go through the list and if you encounter a light disk to the left of a dark disk swap them\" does. However, making a single function, for a recursive search algorithm that needs to return every possible solution path (a series of actions that lead to a correct solution), is relatively hard. Therefore, we will introduce a framework that can be used for any state-space problem. This framework can then either only use valid state-spaces, e.g., as we saw in the lecture in the wolf, goat, and cabbage problem, or can use any state-space defined by all actions. For example, for the wolf, goat, and cabbage problem, this would mean that the first action is not only limited to taking the goat but can also be taking the wolf or cabbage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do a similar exercise by making permutations of a list. First, we will use a state-space that only leads to correct solutions then we will use a more general state-space filter out wrong solutions. To do all this we will make use of the framework explained below.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous solution for the Manhattan problem, we used a state-space that included all road positions. However, this uses a lot of resources not only in memory but also in speed. A lot of decisions in this state-space could be phrased in English as \"just keep going\". The graph representation of this state-space would look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ManhattanGraph.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the graph above, you could say that all nodes that are \"just keep going\" nodes, can be removed from the graph as they do not change the outcome of the routes. This would result in the graph below, which is much smaller and quicker to traverse. However, making this graph is not as straight forward and a separate algorithm is required to do it. This leads to the trade-off of how many times are you using the graph and is it worth it to transform it to the smaller graph representation. The important is that both are valid state-space representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ManhattanGraphSmall.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can find a Node class that is used to build a graph representing the road network. Please, make sure you understand the attributes and how this class would make a whole graph. You do not have to build anything with the class but the Node class represents the graph. Of course, this problem could also be solved using an adjacency list. Here, we use a Node class to let you practice with different datastructures. You can also find an algorithm that transforms an array representation into a small graph representation. This is given to let you test both algorithms on the same array. You can ignore the code itself which is also NOT an example of how to write good code. "

So, in contrast to depth-first search, we do not need any recursion. However, the recursion did a lot of \"remembering\" for us. Now, we really need to store all the information ourselves. Therefore, dividing your code into several methods is still good practice. Below, you can find a framework to do this.\n",

However, this is not an easy algorithm to come up with. Often the fastest algorithm to solve a problem is unknown which means that we need to use search algorithms. Therefore, we will implement a depth-first search and breadth-first search to solve the Tower of Hanoi. To make it a bit easier we only consider actions that generate correct state-spaces and we are not interested in the fastest path to solve the problem. So, any path that leads to a correct solution is good. Below, you can see the state-space of the tower of Hanoi with 3 disks if you only allow valid actions.\n",

    "As you can see, this state-space has a lot of cycles in the solution graph. Finding a correct solution path in a cyclic state-space graph is much harder than in a state-space that is a tree or at least an acyclic graph. The reason is that you can keep taking actions that leads you in circles and you never reach an end node. One way to solve this problem is to remember which state you already visited and discard any path that visited a state more than once.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we will implement a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the state-space of any tower of Hanoi problem. There is a new problem when traversing the state-space of a tower of Hanoi problem because we can go in circles as the graph is cyclic. This can also be seen in the state-space images of the tower of Hanoi. One way of solving this problem is to add some kind of memory to the depth-first-search algorithm that prevents us from walking in circles. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have a new attribute that stores which states are already visited and when you come across a state you already visited you just go back and don't continue exploring. This problem is similar to the breadth-first search history problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible actions for each state-space are given in the class attribute `possible_action`. The path you will find with depth-first search given this order does not give the optimal solution. Is there an order of `possible_action` actions that leads to the optimal solution? Below, you can see the solution you should find when using the given order of possible actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"exercise4_{student}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards we strongly advise renaming the **\"exercise4_{student}_notebook.py\"** file to the correct file name that you need to hand in **\"exercise4_{student}.py\"**. Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise4_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

    "Next, you can upload your Python file with the correct name on brightspace in the bonus assignment. Follow the instructions on this brightspace page carefully to have a successful submission. After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***. If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
