    "# Welcome to Week 2: Trees \\& Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's programming exercise, you will be working on implementing a Tree and Node class in Python. Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the class Tree by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercise, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables). ***Note, that a helper method must start with a \"_\"***.\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the customMagic.py nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is given as a Jupyter notebook, you might run this in your browser by starting a notebook server or through VScode (PyCharm only allows for read-only mode for jupyter notebooks, unless you have Pycharm-pro which is a paid version or you need a student license). The simplest way to [install jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/), a custom python distribution and packagemanager used for Data Science. If you do not want to install all of Anaconda you can also install jupyter via pip: ``pip3 install jupyter`` (`pip3` or `pip` will work depending on how you installed python3). You can find a tutorial for running the notebook [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html). With VScode the IDE should guide you in installing the correct packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

    "Linked lists are useful data structures, but a double-linked list is often more appropriate. The downside of the double-linked list is that it takes more memory on your computer (per object you need to save which node comes next and which came before). However, the major advantage is that you can go through them front-to-back but also back-to-front. Also, often when doing operations it makes the code easier and faster, such operations could be, inserting a value before another value in the list. With a double-linked list, you can search for the value and then go back a step to update the list. With a single linked list you either need to go through the list twice or constantly save the previous and current objects in the list.\n",

    "This idea of going both ways in a double-linked list can also be applied to trees and is often the preferred implementation of a tree.

    "# 4.0 List Representation of a Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we supplied you with a `show` method to check your work. However, normally classes do not come with preprogrammed `show` methods and it is often up to you to write a good representation method for the class for debugging and testing. Representation of a class is made with `__repr__`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note, that `__str__` is not the same as this is the method to convert an object of your class to a string, which can be something totally different than the `__repr__`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `__repr__` magic method down below for the `BinaryTree` class which makes it also work for the `BinaryTreeSearch` class through inheritance. The inheritance is done for you throughout this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, the representation of a tree will be a recursively nested list. The rules are stated below the examples. For example, a tree with one node (info=10) looks like this: `[10]`. Below, you can find a few more elaborate examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: \\\n",
    "`root(info=10) -> [left(info=5), right(info=15)]` will have the representation\\\n",
    "`[10 -> [5, 15]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: \\\n",
    "`root(info=5) -> [left(None), right(info=10) -> [left(None), right(info=15)]]` will have the representation\\\n",
    "`[5 -> [10 -> [15]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: A tree that is made by adding the following values to an empty tree in the order: 5,3,1,10,7,6,8,12, will have the representation\\\n",
    "`[5 -> [3 -> [1], 10 -> [7 -> [6, 8], 12]]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are:\n",
    " - The representation of the Node is used to represent a node. In the example, the representation of the node is assumed to be the `info` of the node.\n",
    " - To signal a parent-child relation a ` -> ` is used with on either side a white space.\n",
    " - After an arrow follows a list with the left and right child separated by a comma, see example 1. Thus the first item in the list is the left child and the second item is the right child.\n",
    " - If a child has its own children then this is again indicated with an arrow.\n",
    " - Note, that a comma has no white space on the left and one on the right.\n",
    " - An empty tree is represented by an empty list, thus `self.root = None` -> `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Important note, the print statement in python converts everything to a string if it is not a string. Therefore, it uses the `__str__` magic method of objects. If you want to use `__repr__` you need to use `print(repr(obj))` unless `__str__` is not overwritten by you as the default of `__str__` is calling `__repr__`.***"

However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes.

Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***.

In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
