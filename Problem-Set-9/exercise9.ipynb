    "In this lab, we will see how dynamic programming can speed up our algorithms and possibly reduce their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",

    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

In this problem, we have a triangle of numbers where paths exist from the top of the triangle to the bottom of the triangle. Your job is to find the path with the smallest sum.

We will generate a random triangle of numbers as a triangle object that contains the top node. Each Node then contains two other nodes that are the lower left and lower right node. Note, that this triangle object is not a binary tree but a graph as, from a tree datastructure point of view, parents share the same children. In the `Node` object, we will call it `left` and `right` referring to the lower left and lower right nodes.\n",

    "# 3.0 Calculating Prime Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will efficiently calculate prime numbers using bottom-up dynamic programming. A number is a prime number if it is only divisible by itself or 1. Therefore, we can use three facts to check if a number is prime:\n",
    " - If a number is not divisible by any other prime number then it is also not divisible by all other numbers. Reason: All non-prime numbers consist of a multiplication of prime numbers. So, if a number would be divisible by a non-prime number it would also be divisible by a prime number.\n",
    " - If we checked all numbers up to the square root of the number and none of the numbers are a proper divisor then we know that the number is a prime number. Reason: All numbers larger than the square root of the number have an outcome lower than the square root of the number and we already checked those.\n",
    " - A proper divisor of a number is a positive whole number excluding zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Now, think of an algorithm that uses these facts to create an effective bottom-up dynamic programming approach for calculating prime numbers***"

    "# 4.0 UNITTESTS\n",
    "\n",
    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"exercise9_{student}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards we strongly advise renaming the **\"exercise9_{student}_notebook.py\"** file to the correct file name that you need to hand in **\"exercise9_{student}.py\"**. Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise9_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to add your own unittests. \n",

    "## Uploading to Brightspace for Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can upload your Python file with the correct name on brightspace in the bonus assignment. Follow the instructions on this brightspace page carefully to have a successful submission. After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***. If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE, that you can now also upload the exercises from week 1! The process is exactly the same only there is no unittest.***"
