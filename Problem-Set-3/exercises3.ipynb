    "# Welcome to Week 3: Linked List & complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's programming exercise, you will be working on implementing various linked list classes in Python, coding various algorithms, and checking if you can notice the difference in complexity. Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is given as a Jupyter notebook, you might run this in your browser by starting a notebook server or through VScode (PyCharm only allows for read-only mode for jupyter notebooks, unless you have Pycharm-pro which is a paid version or you need a student license). The simplest way to [install jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/), a custom python distribution and packagemanager used for Data Science. If you do not want to install all of Anaconda you can also install jupyter via pip: ``pip3 install jupyter`` (`pip3` or `pip` will work depending on how you installed python3). You can find a tutorial for running the notebook [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html). With VScode the IDE should guide you in installing the correct packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",

    "# Inheritance \n",
    "\n",
    "*This paragraph is not needed to make the exercises but without it some parts can feel like magic.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will actively use inheritance to make our classes. However, don't worry you do not need to use it yourself and we will only use it to reduce the amount of code we need to write. So, to simplify it a bit you can see inheritance as a coping-pasting code from one class to the other. To be able to do this exercise you need to understand the following things about inheritance:\n",
    " 1. To use inheritance you put the class you want to copy-paste to the new class inside the brackets. For example `class Queue(LinkedList): ...`, here all the content of the `LinkedList` class is copied to `Queue`. Again, this is done for you during this exercise. You can see inheritance as a tree, where all code from nodes above the current node is copied to the current node. In other words, all code from classes higher up in the tree is inherited by this class. \n",
    " 2. Each class can only have one method with the same name, thus if you use the same name for a method twice in a class the first instance of the method will be overwritten by the second. This works the same for inheritance, if `LinkedList` contains a method `pop` and you use the same method name `pop` in `Queue` then the `pop` method defined in `Queue` will overwrite it. Note, that in `LinkedList` `pop` is not overwritten as that class does not \"see\" the `Queue` class as it sits higher in the tree. Again, all methods that need to be redefined are given. you only need to understand that you can use methods of the class that you inherit from.\n",
    " 3. To add even more flexibility, you can overwrite a method in your new class but copy the code from the old method into the new method. This is done with `super({class_name}, self).{method_you_want_to_copy}(arguments)`. This copies all code from the \"method_you_want_to_copy\" into the new method (usually with the same name). Again, you do not need yo use it your self, but you need to understand what it does if you see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through some examples of why we need this behavior and why it is useful:\n",
    " 1. A double-linked list is the same as a linked list but with some extras, therefore it makes sense to copy everything from the linked list implementation to the double-linked list implementation and only overwrite some methods. Thus the first point is very useful.\n",
    " 2. Now let's look at a specific method in the classes linked list and double linked list. Let's say we have a nice `__repr__` method to visualize a linked list. Then instead of copy-pasting this `__repr__` method to each class, we can use inheritance to do this for us. This has also the added benefit of making the code DRY because now you either have a correct implementation of `__repr__` or you don't. Compared to not using inheritance where each class can be correct or incorrect independently of each other.\n",
    " 3. Sometimes a method for two classes is the same but one class needs a bit more code. Again, a linked list has only a start node while a double-linked list has a start and end node. So, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class LinkedList():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, start):\n",
    "        self.start = start\n",
    "\n",
    "class DoubleLinkedList(LinkedList):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, start, end):\n",
    "        super(DoubleLinkedList).__init__(start)  # This would be similar to just typing \"self.start = start\".\n",
    "        self.end = end\n",
    "```"

This is useful when, for example, if you later search for a value you can print this \"node\" in a way that you understand the print.

However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",

Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
