## Notes

- In Task 1.2: A minor problem is box indexing, unlike the image given in the beginning of the notebook file, starts from 0 instead of 1. It will affect the whole programming logic and indexing - Discuss whether we need to change or not.

- In Task 1.3: As mentioned in the project description, 0 items should be ignored, and the check method will return True if the sudoku is not completed yet, but there is no duplication based on rules.
