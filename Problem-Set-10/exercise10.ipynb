    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will see for a second time how dynamic programming can speed up our algorithms and possibly reduce their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the exercise, you will be extending the classes by completing code stubs in their respective cells. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each exercise. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the exercises, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:'\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the `customMagic.py` nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your exercise is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",

    "# 2.0 Coin Change Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Two weeks ago, we solved the coin problem using divide and conquer. While this approach worked, it was not very fast and even giving back all possibilities for giving back for 50 cents took a long time. This week we will apply dynamic programming on top of the divide-and-conquer approach to make the algorithm faster. The approach will be the same as two weeks ago where we do take the largest coin or not. See the description below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Description of 2.0 Coin Change Problem lab 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the coin problem, we have an unlimited amount of coins of the following type: 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 euro, and 2 euros. The goal is to find all ways to give change for a certain amount so for example if we want to give change for 5 cents we can do that in 4 ways: 5x 1 cent, 3x 1 cent + 1x 2 cents, 1x 1 cent + 2x 2 cents, and 1x 5 cents. Note, that there is no order in which we give the change. So, the only thing that matters is what coins and how many of these coins we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to come up with a pseudo-algorithm that uses Divide and Conquer to solve this problem. The idea should be similar to the equal subset problem where you split the problem into two subproblems, where in one case you choose to use the largest coin and in the other case you don't. \n",

    "## 2.2 Dynamic Programming \n",
    "\n",
    "As said this week we will do the same, however, we store all sub-results so they can be used for other calculations. Also, to avoid floating point errors, we will represent all amounts in cents. So 1 euro will be 100 cents. \n",

The rod sizes that you can sell are the natural number from 1 to $n$ and each length has its own price. For example, you have a rod of length 4 and the prices are length 1: 1 euro, length 2: 5 euros, length 3: 8 euros, length 4: 9 euros. Therefore, we can sell the rod in the following ways, with a total sum of:\n",

    "So far, we have reduced the time complexity to a polynomial function, and while this is a really big improvement from the naive/suboptimal algorithm. It came at the cost of using more memory. In this course, we do not cover space complexity (memory usage), but in this case, it is $n^2$, which can be easily seen by the fact that we use a table with rows and columns. However, this could be reduced to $n$, in other words, there is a dynamic programming solution that uses a table with one row. Try to find a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm that has the same complexity as our divide-and-conquer top-down dynamic programming algorithm but uses only one row. In other words, the recurrence relation should only depend on the rod size and not the max cutting size. What is this new recurrence relation?\n",

    "# 6.0 UNITTESTS\n",
    "\n",
    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"exercise10_{student}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are merely a check to see if your **.py** is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards we strongly advise renaming the **\"exercise10_{student}_notebook.py\"** file to the correct file name that you need to hand in **\"exercise10_{student}.py\"**. Now, you can adjust the **\"exercise10_{student}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on if you make a change in the Python file and you want to go back to the notebook later that you also make this change in the notebook. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to add your own unittests. \n",

    "## Uploading to Brightspace for Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can upload your Python file with the correct name on brightspace in the bonus assignment. Follow the instructions on this brightspace page carefully to have a successful submission. After you get the feedback for this exercise you can either continue working in the Python file to fix possible bugs or you can go back to the notebook and remake the Python file. ***Please be careful, do not update your code in both the Python file and notebook at the same time!***. If you go back to the notebook do not forget to update the notebook with any changes you made within the Python file. In this case, it is best to just delete the Python file as soon as you copied all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE, that you can now also upload the exercises from week 1! The process is exactly the same only there is no unittest.***"
